# Project Solfeggio frequencies 

## Disclaimer!
- This is a 'fictitious' project in that it is **not** intended to act as a source of truthful or accurate information.

## Introduction
This website targets people with an interest in sound therapy, specificlly the **Solfeggio frequencies**. 
It is a simple project that attempts to spread useful information on this topic by mapping out famous frequencies in order, making it easy to remember and/or have as a cheatsheet. 

The vision for this project is to implement more intricate systems with playable sound, more detailed information, community chats, and meet-ups. Moreover, organizations could perhaps get access to special systems that can be implemented in spa's, hotells, therapy facilities, and other places that aim to promote health.

### Navigation system
All pages on this website share the same navigation system. It is a fully responsive system that collapses into a clickable hamburger icon on smaller screen sizes (mobile) and a typical navigation layout on larger screen sizes (desktop). When you click the hamburger icon on mobile, a container will pop up listing the page links in a column instead of a row. The links have a relatively large margin, making it easy to navigate on a small devices.

### Header image
The header image represents a waveform that attempts to signal to the user's first impression that this website's theme is all about frequencies. Captivating users using their interest as bait (for good intensions of course).

## Vision

There are a lot of features that could be added to this project. As already mentioned, audio integration, and more intricate systems for learning about sound and sound therapy. As of right now, the website is very minimalistic and the user should have the option to dive into more advanced realms. Perhaps with expandable sections or a global mode that switches to a more complex view. 


## Maintenance 

Due to this project's minimalistic charactaristics, it would be optimal to introduce Javascript for future development. This was intended to be a pure HTML and CSS project and to manage close buttons and conditional logic can be quite compehensive as the project grow in size. 

Nevertheless, the code for this project is built with sustainability in mind. For example, CSS classes and id's are locked in groups to promote further development without having to reorganize previous code.
